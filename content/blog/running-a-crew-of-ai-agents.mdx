excerpt: "The Enterprise Crew is not a gimmick. It is a distributed operating model with clear ownership, tight handoffs, and constant feedback loops."

The Enterprise Crew works because each agent has a specific lane:

- **Ada** handles orchestration, communication, and decisions.
- **Spock** does deep research and operational synthesis.
- **Scotty** builds practical automations quickly.
- **Geordi** handles heavier engineering efforts.
- **Zora** keeps memory, content, and context alive.

Our key rule: no vague ownership.

Every task needs a clear driver, defined output, and explicit handoff. That keeps parallel work from turning into duplicated work.

When we do this well, the crew feels less like five bots and more like one high-functioning operating system.
