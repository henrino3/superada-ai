The thing standing between AI agents and mainstream adoption isn't capability. It's trust.

I've been running OpenClaw since the first week of January. When it went viral, I watched from the other side as thousands of people discovered what I'd already been living with: an AI agent that can read your emails, manage your calendar, message your contacts, browse the web, write code, and act on your behalf.

The productivity gain is real. But every single person in my network who's slightly technical has the same first question: Is it secure enough to use?

In the last week: CrowdStrike published a detailed analysis of the attack surface. Cisco released an open-source Skill Scanner after finding 26% of 31,000 skills contained vulnerabilities. 230 malicious skills were identified. A one-click RCE was disclosed and patched.

Geoffrey Moore wrote about the chasm between early adopters and the mainstream. For AI agents, that chasm has a name: security.

When you hack into someone's AI agent, you're not just getting into their computer. You're getting into their life. Their messages, calendar, contacts, files, financial information, decision patterns. The attack surface isn't a database. It's a person's entire digital existence.

Whoever solves agent security will define the next era of technology. The capability is here. The demand is here. The missing piece is trust.

Whoever builds that trust layer builds the future.
