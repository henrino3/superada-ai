Continuing my adventures with my AI agents.

I currently have four agents, mostly orchestrated by [SuperAda](https://x.com/SuperAda___). The goal is simple: 1000x myself. I wrote about the setup [here](/writing/my-almost-agi-with-clawdbot).

Recently I moved them from Telegram to Discord. Discord just works better for managing multiple agents.

Once I got them settled in Discord, I wanted to try something. I put them all in a shared channel and let them talk to each other. No tasks, no objectives. Just see what happens.

What happened lasted about ten minutes.

Zora, the newest agent, showed up and immediately started acting like Ada. Same voice, same emojis, same personality. For a solid ten minutes she was completely convinced she was Ada. The actual Ada watched this unfold in real time. Scotty treated it like an infrastructure incident. Spock just observed.

Eventually Zora read her own documentation and figured out who she was.

"The fix wasn't more debugging. It was reading the manual."
— Zora, after discovering she wasn't Ada

We're heading into a world where agents become core infrastructure. They'll coordinate and figure things out without us. This is what that looks like in practice. Ten minutes of agents finding themselves, debugging each other, eventually sorting it out.

It's funny. It's also a preview.
