The next competitive advantage isn't your product. It's your AI.

Not the chatbot on your website. Not the copilot you bolt on. The operating system behind your entire company.

A researcher picks their lab based on compute. An F1 driver is only as good as the car underneath them. Hamilton in a Mercedes wins championships. Hamilton in a Williams finishes midfield. Same driver. Different machine. Different outcome.

The tools you have access to determine the level of work you can do. AI is about to make this 100x more true.

We're heading toward a world where every company has an AI layer. An operating system that sits underneath every employee, every workflow, every decision. One person paired with the right AI does what a team of ten does without it. That's not efficiency. That's a new category.

And this changes how talent works. Right now people leave companies for better pay, better culture, better titles. Soon they'll leave for better AI.

But zoom out further and it's not just software. It's not even an operating system. It's a city. Because these won't stay as tools. They'll become entities. Billions of autonomous intelligences that need to live somewhere, grow somewhere, interact somewhere.
